# This is an example module to be used as a template.

#
# NOTE: py3status will NOT execute:
#     - methods starting with '_'
#     - methods decorated by @property and @staticmethod
#
# NOTE: reserved method names:
#     - 'kill' method for py3status exit notification
#     - 'on_click' method for click events from i3bar (read below please)
#
# WARNING:
#
# Do NOT use print on your modules: py3status will catch any output and discard
# it silently because this would break your i3bar (see issue #20 for details).
# Make sure you catch any output from any external program you may call
# from your module. Any output from an external program cannot be caught and
# silenced by py3status and will break your i3bar so please, redirect any
# stdout/stderr to /dev/null for example (see issue #20 for details).

    The Py3status class name is mandatory.

    Below you list all the available configuration parameters and their
    default value for your module which can be overwritten by users
    directly from their i3status config.

    This examples features only two parameters:
    'cache_timeout' is set to 10 seconds (0 would mean no cache).
    'format' this allows users to customise their output.  In this example we
    have a status string placeholder.  This will be replaced by the module.
    Some modules have multiple placeholders.  For examples look at the included
    py3status modules.
