* rename the examples folder to modules and include it in the installed files

version 1.4 (2014-04-16)

* Merge pull request #25 from nawadanp/master

version 1.2 (2014-01-12)
* new module dpms.py allowing activation and deactivation of DPMS thx to André Doser
* order i3status output updates to prevent it from overwritting any modification made on i3status json list by a user module, this avoids a possible user filter flapping on i3status modules
* fix delay on first execution of each module which could be equal to py3status interval time before being executed
* the real i3status thread output json list is passed to all modules as the i3status_output_json parameter, this allows any user module to change any of the i3status output by simply altering the given json on the list, inspired thx to @drestebon on issue #23
* add validation for the position parameter
* Merge pull request #21 from patrickshan/master
* make cpu status cached for 10s and leave the output index to 0, by Patrick Shan
* add cpu usage info to sysdata script, by Patrick Shan

version 1.1 (2013-12-15)
* new generic click event handler using the special module file named i3bar_click_events.py which will be forwarded any orphan click event for action. this allows you to take action on clicks made on your i3status modules !
* add the filename as the module_name property to the Module class
* drop useless modes on examples
* new example whoami displaying the currently logged in user
* be more concrete in the i3status.conf example
* add IRC information, join us on #py3status on freenode to share your ideas or ask for help
* redirect stdout and stderr to null to suppress modules outputs, this prevents i3bar from frezzing when a user module prints something to stdout or stderr wrt issue #20
* use base stdout for the output on i3bar
* fix first event opening line wrt issue #19 thx to @lathan
* fix delay on py3status start waiting for i3status, this caused a useless first refresh delay of py3status of i3status interval seconds, thx to @Edholm on issue #18

* fix respect user's locale for time transformation, thx to @Edholm on issue #18
* new example module displaying Yahoo Weather forcast
* Merge pull request #15 from alethiophile/master
* Float update-time option, by Tom Hunt

version 1.0 (2013-08-30)
* total rewrite (yes, again)
* support for i3bar click_events, they're dispatched to user-written py3status classes based on their name/instance
* add support for on_click methods in user-written modules to handle i3bar click_events (see the pomodoro example)
* default is to clear the method's cache (force a refresh) if you middle click (button 2) on a method's output and the module does not support click_events
* rewrite pomodoro example to showcase the on_click usage
* use i3-nagbar to display warnings/errors to the user and also log them to syslog
* new user-written module output ordering mechanism is more intuitive as it uses strictly numeric then alphabetical sorting
* use select/poll() to implement a non-blocking I/O reading mechanism on threads
* new Events thread is responsible for reading i3bar JSONs and dispatching them to the correct user module (click_events)
* each user-written module is started and executed in its own thread
* remove the pointless -d option
* add a --debug option to be verbose in syslog (useful for debugging your modules)
* add a real CHANGELOG
* add a proper LICENSE file
* make sure all examples are PEP8 compatible
* update the empty_class example to explain on_click and kill usage
